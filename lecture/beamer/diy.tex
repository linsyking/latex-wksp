    You are right, but \LaTeX\ is a brand-new typesetting system
    independently developed by Leslie Lamport. The system is based
    on a language called ``\TeX'', which powers ``macro packages'',
    to guide your writing. You will be the powerful role known as
    the ``user'', reading documentation and using all kinds of
    commands and environments; you will write impressive articles
    and beamers — and in the meantime reveal the truth of ``\LaTeX''.

    \[
        e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta
    \]

    \[
        e^{i \theta + \varphi} = e^\varphi (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
    \]

    \[
        e^{i \pi} = -1
    \]

    In physics, the convention is $j$ because $i$ stands for current.
